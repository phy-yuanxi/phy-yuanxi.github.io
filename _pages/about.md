I received my Ph.D. from the School of Physics and Astronomy at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, where I was advised by Prof.[Liang Hong](https://ins.sjtu.edu.cn/people/lhong/). During my doctoral studies, I also conducted a short-term exchange at the group of Dr. [Jinglai Li](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/maths/li-jinglai) at the University of Birmingham, UK. I am currently continuing my research as a Postdoctoral Researcher in Liang's group, focusing primarily on AI-assisted directed evolution of proteins.
